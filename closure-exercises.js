// 1) Make a counter function that returns a function that returns a successive number each time it is called.

// 2) Allow the caller of counter to initialize the count to the first argument that's passed in

// 3) Allow the counter to either increment 1 or decrement by 1 by calling the increment and decrement methods, respectively. Note: now the counter needs to return an object rather than a function.
